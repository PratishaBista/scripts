# Sum Prediction

The "sum_prediction.py" program tries to predict the sum of all the digits the user enters. A very silly program. The execution and the instructions provided might not be clear. However, this is something I decided I wanted to program right when my lil cousin brother showed me this trick on pen and paper. It's just something I implemented out of curiosity.

## How It Works

1. You enter five digits (with some restrictions, like the last digit must be greater than or equal to 2).
2. The program guesses the "final sum" of all the digits involved.
3. It asks you to input additional sets of five digits.
4. Based on some calculations, the program generates its own digits that sum to 9 when added to the numbers you entered.
5. At the end, the program calculates the total sum of all digits and checks if it matches the guessed "final sum."
